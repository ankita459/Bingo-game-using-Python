# Bingo-game-using-Python

In this code, we first use the random module to generate a random number between 0 and 99. Then we ask the user to input a number using the input() function, and convert it to an integer using the int() function.

We then use an if statement to check if the user's guess is equal to the random number. If it is, we print "Bingo!". Otherwise, we print "Better Luck Next Time!".
